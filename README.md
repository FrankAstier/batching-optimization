Experiment description
----------------------
In this experiment, we study the "batch optimization", that maximizes RAM bandwidth usage, by issuing a lot of
load commands all at once (for a batch), then letting the processor run a "payload" of other instructions.
Essentially, since all the loads from main memory are done in parallel, it is faster than issuing a load,
processing an instruction, issuing another load, processing another instruction...

We randomly access values in a big, statically allocated array (that doesn't fit in L3), and perform various amounts
of processing on those values. "Batching" consists in grouping the lookup and processing of values into "batches" of
small size. We want to understand what is the optimal batch size, and how the "batching optimization" depends on the
amount of work done on each value.

The setup that produced the results in the folder linux.results is detailed here.
Compilation was also verified with clang.

Data file format
----------------
The file name indicates the "payload": identity, payload, p1, p2... Refer to batch_optimization.cpp for details.
Each file line has the following format:
>     <algorithm name (2 words)> <batch_size (1 integer)> <latency1 (integer, microseconds)> <latency2> ...
